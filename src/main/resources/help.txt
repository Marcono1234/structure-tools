Structure Tools
(https://github.com/Marcono1234/structure-tools)

Tools for working with Minecraft structure files. To inspect structure 
files use an NBT editor, such as https://github.com/jaquadro/NBTExplorer.

Keep in mind that vanilla Minecraft officially only supports 32*32*32 structures 
and larger custom structures might not be usable at some point. Additionally 
structures might not be very memory efficient and other ways of placing the blocks 
might suit better.

Command usage:
"command glue <config> <layout> <output_path>"
    - Config:
        JSON file with the following content:
        {
            "author": <String>, optional; default = no author
            "dataVersion": <int>, optional; DataVersion to write; 
                            default = use highest DataVersion of all structures
            "writeFakeSize": <boolean>, optional; Whether the maximum vanilla size
                            should be written instead of the actual one, allows 
                            using "LOAD" button in Minecraft structure block GUI;
                            default = true
        }
    - Layout:
        JSON file with the following structure:
        [  
        ↑   [
        |   ↑   [--x-→],
        |   z   [--x-→],
        |   |   [--x-→]
        y   ],
        |   [
        |   ↑   [--x-→],
        |   z   [--x-→],
        |   |   [--x-→]
        |   ]
        ]
        
        The "x" lists contain file paths to the structure files to use. Lists 
        can be empty or contain 'null' to skip the entry.
        
        Let's say you have three structures:
            - x1y0z0.nbt
            - x0y0z1.nbt
            - x0y1z0.nbt
        And want to place them at the position corresponding to their name. Then 
        the layout file could look like this:
        [
            [
                ["x0y1z0.nbt"]
            ],
            [
                ["x0y0z1.nbt"],
                [null, "x1y0z0.nbt"]
            ]
        ]
    - Output path
        File path with extension to use for the created structure.

    "Glues" together multiple structure files. It is assumed that the size of each 
    structure is the vanilla maximum. The program will refuse to glue larger structures 
    since they might overwrite each other. If the sizes of the structures are not the 
    vanilla maximum, it is recommended to load them in a Minecraft world and lay them 
    out there. Afterwards the structure can be saved as maximum sized vanilla 
    structures and glued together.
